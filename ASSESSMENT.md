### Amazee Labs Restaurant Menu App

The app is built using the most current version of React (16.5.2) in order to utilize the new Context API. I opted to use the Context API for state management because the app is small. I felt that Redux would require too much overhead on the application. The Context API gives app level state management without the extra weight. 

## Style Notes
The stylesheet located at `src/index.css` is the only one for the site. [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) is used for CSS-in-JS styling. Other styles are defaults from [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).
